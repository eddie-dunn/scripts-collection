## `pruneLocalBranches`

When merging PRs with Github it's not uncommon to also remove the origin
branch, since it's not useful any more.

However, this easily leads to a lot of garbage local branches that
normally have to be cleaned up manually which is tedious.

This script automates the process for you.
